# Tetris
A simple Tetris game made with HTML and Javascript.

This game was made for a small test in the application process. It had a specific set of rules that the game should follow:

1.  The game should have five different tetris game pieces.
2.  The active piece does not move down by itself with time. Instead, it only moves down when you press one of the           following four keys that do additional movements:
      a) Move Left
      d) Move Right
      w) Rotate piece counter-clockwise
      s) Rotate piece clockwise
3.  The completed lines do not disappear like they do in the normal Tetris game.
4.  A new active tetris piece appears on top when the current piece does not have any more possible moves to make.
5.  The game ends when a new piece appears on top of an existing one.
